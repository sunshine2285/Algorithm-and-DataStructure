**Description**

Bill and Ted are taking a road trip. But the odometer in their car is broken, so they don't know how many miles they have driven. Fortunately, Bill has a working stopwatch, so they can record their speed and the total time they have driven. Unfortunately, their record keeping strategy is a little odd, so they need help computing the total distance driven. You are to write a program to do this computation. For example, if their log shows

| Speed in miles perhour | Total elapsed time in hours |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 20                     | 2                           |
| 30                     | 6                           |
| 10                     | 7                           |


this means they drove 2 hours at 20 miles per hour, then 6-2=4 hours at 30 miles per hour, then 7-6=1 hour at 10 miles per hour. The distance driven is then (2)(20) + (4)(30) + (1)(10) = 40 + 120 + 10 = 170 miles. Note that the total elapsed time is always since the beginning of the trip, not since the previous entry in their log.

**Input**

 The input consists of one or more data sets. Each set starts with a line containing an integer n, 1 <= n <= 10, followed by n pairs of values, one pair per line. The first value in a pair, s, is the speed in miles per hour and the second value, t, is the total elapsed time. Both s and t are integers, 1 <= s <= 90 and 1 <= t <= 12. The values for t are always in strictly increasing order. A value of -1 for n signals the end of the input. 

**Output**

 For each input set, print the distance driven, followed by a space, followed by the word "miles" .

**Sample Input**

```
3
20 2
30 6
10 7
2
60 1
30 5
4
15 1
25 2
30 3
10 5
-1
```

**Sample Output**

```
170 miles
180 miles
90 miles
```

**Code** *(cpp)*

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	int n = 0;
	cin >> n;
	int sum = 0;
	int lastHours = 0;
	int currentHours = 0;
	int speed = 0;
	while (n != -1)
	{

		for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
		{
			cin >> speed >> currentHours;
			sum += (currentHours - lastHours) * speed;
			lastHours = currentHours;
		}

		cout << sum << " miles" << endl;

		sum = 0;
		lastHours = 0;
		cin >> n;
	}

	return 0;
}
```
